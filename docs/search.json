    "text": "This blog, titled ‘HasturBoxerShorts’, was created for a course during my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics at the University of Idaho. My professor, Dr. Barrie Robison, said we should title our blog and directory something informative, but that he wouldn’t stop us if we wanted to title it ‘HasturBoxerShorts’, so here we are.\nThe first project posted to my blog was a short assignment to look at literate progamming. My purpose for this project was to create a template that could be used later for my actual research projects. Hopefully I will have some work done before the end of this course. Otherwise, I may resort to using my MS thesis research.\nFuture projects will be posted throughout the duration of this course."

Despite my best efforts to save them (by watching it all happen in slow motion), Elsa fell over while trying to pose for this picture.\n\n\nPets\nI am also obsessed with my cats. They are the cutest cats in the world, and I’m not even being biased.\n\nHere are my two cats, Fudge (left) and Fig (right). They like to cuddle, with each other and me, tear up my furniture, and sprint around the house screaming at 3am.\n\n\nHobbies\nI also like to play games, such as board games and tabletop role-play games like DnD.\n\nHere is an AI-generated image (Gemini) depicting my first DnD character, a tiefling named Oriella. She is also my longest played character, as my group managed to drag out the The Rise of Tiamat to be a 7 year campaign. I think we all believe we will still finish it someday."

    "text": "This project aims to examine how bacteriophage could be used to combat diseases in honeybees. One deadly pathogen that threatens the honeybee is European Foulbrood (EFB), which is caused by the bacteria Melissococcus plutonius. M. plutonius can devastate hives by killing off larvae, and has no “cure”. Our lab has sequenced 6 different isolates of M. plutonius obtained from an apiary in Minnesota. These isolates were analyzed to identify regions of the genome that may be a prophage, a bacteriophage integrated into the host genome. Some prophage may actually be temperate phage, which can be induced to enter the lytic cycle, thereby infecting and killing bacteria. If we can identify prophage, we can then attempt to induce temperate phage. The identification and obtainment of bacteriophage that can infect M. plutonius will allow us to pursue an avenue to support honeybee health without the use of antibiotics. Currently, no bacteriophage have been isolate and identified for M. plutonius. After our attempts to induce temperate phage, we will also examine environmental samples taken from the apiary for the presence of any bacteriophage which may infect M. plutonius.\n\n\n\nIdentify prophage in M. plutonius genome\nInduce temperate phage from M. plutonius genome\nFind bacteriophage in environmental samples"

The goal is to see if there are any interesting patterns in the data to follow up on.\n\nNumber of Prophage by Isolate\nFirst, let’s plot the number of prophage for each isolate. We sequenced 6 isolates of M. plutonius. The name of each of the 6 M. plutonius isolates can be found in the column “Isolate”, and the number of prophage can be found in the column “Number_Intact_Prophage”.\n\n#Create a plot using the dataframe with isolate information\n#Isolates on x axis\n(plot_iso &lt;- ggplot(df,aes(x=Isolate,\n                           #Number of prophage on y axis\n                           y=Number_Intact_Prophage))+\n   #Fill columns with a color so it's not boring\n  geom_col(fill=\"goldenrod\")+\n   #Make nice legible axis titles\n   #italicize bacteria name\n  labs(x=expression(paste(italic(\"M. plutonius\"), \" Isolate\")),\n       y=\"Number of Potential Prophage\")+\n   #Adjust themes for legibility\n   #Increases axis title and text size\n  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=20),\n        axis.text=element_text(size=15),\n        #Remove gridlines and color from figure background\n        panel.background=element_blank(),\n        #Make axis lines black\n        axis.line = element_line(colour = \"black\")))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Prophage by Sequence Type\nM. plutonius strains are classified by sequence type, which groups the bacteria by a handful of alleles in specific genes. Specifically, sequence type is determined by the allelic profile of 4 genes. The Sequence Type (ST) of the 6 M. plutonius isolates can be found in the column “Sequnce_Type”\n\n#Create a plot using the dataframe with isolate information\n\n(plot_ST &lt;- df  %&gt;%\n   #summarize average number of prophage by sequence type\n   reframe(avg=mean(Number_Intact_Prophage),.by=Sequence_Type)%&gt;%\n   #ST on x axis\n   ggplot(aes(x=Sequence_Type,\n              #Number of prophage on y axis\n              y=avg,\n              #Colored by the sequence type of strain\n              fill=Sequence_Type))+\n  #Create columns with the number of prophage\n  geom_col()+\n  #Adjust labels for legibility\n  labs(y=\"Number of Potential Prophage\",\n       x=\"Sequence Type\")+\n  #Adjust themes for legibility\n  #Increase axis and legend title and text fonts\n  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=20),\n        axis.text=element_text(size=15),\n        #do not include legend\n        legend.position=\"none\",\n        #Remove gridlines and color from figure background\n        panel.background=element_blank(),\n        #Make axis lines black\n        axis.line = element_line(colour = \"black\")))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Prophage by Clonal Complex\nM. plutonius strains can be classified by clonal complex, which groups the bacteria by highly related genomes and have the same or very similar sequence type. The clonal complex (CC) of the 6 M. plutonius isolates can be found in the column “Clonal_Complex”.\n\n#Create a plot using the dataframe with isolate information\n\n(plot_CC &lt;- df  %&gt;%\n   #summarize average number of prophage by clonal complex\n   reframe(avg=mean(Number_Intact_Prophage),.by=Clonal_Complex)%&gt;%\n   #clonal on x axis\n   ggplot(aes(x=Clonal_Complex,\n              #Number of prophage on y axis\n              y=avg,\n              #Colored by the CC of strain\n              fill=Clonal_Complex))+\n  #Create columns with the number of prophage\n  geom_col()+\n  #Adjust labels for legibility\n  labs(x=\"Clonal Complex\",\n       y=\"Average Number of Potential Prophage\")+\n  #Adjust themes for legibility\n  #Increase axis and legend title and text fonts\n  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=20),\n        axis.text=element_text(size=15),\n        #Do not include a legend\n        legend.position=\"none\",\n        #Remove gridlines and color from figure background\n        panel.background=element_blank(),\n        #Make axis lines black\n        axis.line = element_line(colour = \"black\")))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Prophage by Strain Type\nThe clonal complex can also indicate the type of attributes a strain may exhibit. M. plutonius can be classified by strain type, which groups the bacteria by either typical or atypical attributes. The strain type of the 6 M. plutonius isolates can be found in the column “Type”\n\n#Create a plot using the dataframe with isolate information\n#Isolates on x axis\n(plot_type &lt;- df  %&gt;%\n   #summarize average number of prophage by clonal complex\n   reframe(avg=mean(Number_Intact_Prophage),.by=Type)%&gt;%\n   #Strain_Type\n   ggplot(aes(x=Type,\n              #Number of prophage on y axis\n              y=avg,\n              #Colored by the type of strain\n              fill=Type))+\n  #Create columns with the number of prophage\n  geom_col()+\n  #Adjust labels for legibility\n  labs(x=\"Strain Type\",\n       y=\"Average Number of Potential Prophage\")+\n  #Adjust themes for legibility\n  #Increase axis and legend title and text fonts\n  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=20),\n        axis.text=element_text(size=15),\n        #Do not include a legend\n        legend.position=\"none\",\n        #Remove gridlines and color from figure background\n        panel.background=element_blank(),\n        #Make axis lines black\n        axis.line = element_line(colour = \"black\")))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummarize Data Exploration\nThis code chunk will compile the plots created above into one many paneled plot for further examination and comparison\n\n#arrange the 4 plots into one plot\nggarrange(plot_iso,\n          plot_CC,\n          plot_ST,\n          plot_type,\n          #Add alphabet labels to each plot\n          labels=\"AUTO\")\n\n\n\n#Save plot as a png\nggsave(\"compiled_plots.png\",width=15,height=13)"
